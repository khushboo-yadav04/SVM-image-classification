# 🐱🐶 Image Classification using SVM

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements an **SVM (Support Vector Machine)** classifier to distinguish between images of **cats and dogs**. It involves:
- Image preprocessing
- Feature extraction
- SVM model training
- Evaluation of model performance


## 🎯 Why This Project?

SVMs are powerful supervised learning models, especially for binary classification. The project goals were:
- To apply SVMs in a real-world image classification scenario
- To build a pipeline for preprocessing and model training
- To gain hands-on experience with image datasets and feature engineering


## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib


## 🖼️ Dataset

The dataset includes labeled images of cats and dogs. For efficiency, images are resized and converted to grayscale or flattened vectors for training.
